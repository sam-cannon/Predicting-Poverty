# Predicting-Poverty
This is my capstone project for the Microsoft Professional Program Data Science certification
The purpose of this project was to predict whether an individual would be living above or below the 
poverty line. This was one of my favorite competitions so far, and I had such an awesome time learning
in the Microsoft Professional Program. If anyone has any questions about the code please do not hesitate to
