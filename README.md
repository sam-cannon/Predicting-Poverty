# Predicting-Poverty
This is my capstone project for the Microsoft Professional Program Data Science certification, the final project
was a competition on DrivenData between everyone in the class. My submission finished in 12th place overall
out of more than 500 competitors. There was a limited amount of time for this competition and I know that it could
be improved upon further.

The purpose of this project was to predict whether an individual would be living above or below the 
poverty line. This was one of my favorite competitions so far, and I had such an awesome time learning
in the Microsoft Professional Program. If anyone has any questions about the code please do not hesitate to
